WHEN AND WHERE

As many of you know we are avid college football fans, and season ticket holders for MSU football games (Go Green!). Secondary to this passion, our wedding was planned on the “bye-week” for the football team, NOVEMBER 10th 2012.
The ceremony and reception will both be held at The Crofoot Ballroom in Pontiac, MI.  

Need a hotel?

A block of rooms has been reserved at The Courtyard Marriott, Pontiac, MI. Complimentary shuttle service at the end of the evening will be provided from the reception site to the hotel. If interested, please be sure to book a room before 10/19/12 to ensure you receive our group rate.

Wedding party info:

We have hand selected our closest friends and family to stand beside us as we “take the plunge.” Each of these individuals has known us since the beginning of our relationship, and some of them even longer!
